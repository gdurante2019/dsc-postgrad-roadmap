# DS Post-Graduation Roadmap

## Introduction

Congratulations on graduating from your program!!! It may not have been easy, but you persevered and have become a data scientist. Next, you will need to prepare to start your job search and continue to develop your talents.

This roadmap will help you chart a course through the next six months as you embark on your journey. It can be hard to know what to do in the unstructured time that follows a bootcamp, especially without the regular social contact, routines, or accountability that supported you through it. Now that you are a graduate, it is up to you to establish that structure for yourself. This lesson includes some recommendations for how to structure your time week-to-week and over the coming months.

## Career Services Commitment

Expect to spend about half of your time each week on activities designed by Career Services to help you land a job. There are specific activities you will need to complete as part of the [Career Services Commitment][] to remain eligible for Flatiron's Money-Back Guarantee.

In short, you will need to do the following each week:

- Contact at least eight people at prospective employers
- Post at least one written or video blog post
- Post at least five GitHub contributions to your public profile

**Activity:** [The Weekly Job Search Activity][] lesson from our Career Prep track provides detail and advice for each requirement - complete that lesson now if you haven't already.

## Your To-Do List

You likely have your own mental list of things you've been wanting to do after graduating. This could include...

- Polishing your projects
- Building a personal website
- Reviewing challenging topics
- Reading a book
- Doing some self-care

You will likely find that this roadmap includes some of your to-do list items. Refer back to your to-do list when you create your weekly schedule to fill in any open blocks of time, or if you ever find yourself with extra time on your hands. You may find that you only have time for some items on your to-do list, and that is totally OK.

**Activity:** Write down all of the things you would like to accomplish during this period. Here is a template to help you get started: [Post-Graduation To-Do List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AYQs00F740TD8QAYbCub0AJACLsymBXZIIKk2CBLO5A/copy).

## Post-Graduation Upskilling

We have created a four-week upskilling course to help you continue to develop your Data Science skills after graduation. ***ADD MORE***

## Establish a Weekly Routine

Establishing a weekly routine will help you tremendously in your job search. Your routine will structure your time, remove the need to make new plans each week, and ensure you are completing your required tasks. You can even use your routine strategically to increase your productivity.

Here are a few recommendations for creating your weekly routine:

- Plan to do the things you might not want to do early in the day or week. It will feel good to get these things out of the way early, and can help you avoid anxiety and procrastination. This will enable you to be happier and more productive throughout the week.

- Make rough estimates of how much time you will to spend on each task. This will make sure that you are allocating time as needed for all the things you want to accomplish. Your estimates may not end up being correct, but that is just an opportunity to refine your routine in the future.

- If a task will take more than one day, divide it into chunks and work on it across consecutive days. Dividing it into chunks will make it feel more manageable. You will also be more productive if you make progress on it every day because you will be thinking about it consistently and it will be easier to pick up where you left off.

- Create blocks of time and fill in details later. It's great to have time reserved to research your blog post, but you won't know what that research will actually entail until you've decided what topic you want to cover and in what depth.

- Build buffer and breaks into your schedule each day. Unexpected things will come up, so make space to handle them so you don't fall behind: emails, tech problems, chats with friends, etc. Most people also can't work for 9 hours straight - find a pattern of breaks, both long and short, that keeps you energized and engaged.

- Establish boundaries for your work time. Set a firm start and end time for each day so that you can properly disengage, rest, and re-engage. Identify days (probably weekends) when you won't do any job-related work at all. If you feel the urge to do some work task outside your prescribed time, write it down and use it as motivation when you do get back to work.

Here is an example of what a weekly routine might look like:

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Contact 2 employers (1 hour) | Contact 2 employers (1 hour) | Contact 2 employers (1 hour) | Contact 2 employers (1 hour) | |
| Research blog topic (2 hours) | Start writing blog post (2 hours) | Finish blog post (2 hours) | Make 3 commits (2 hours) | Make 3 commits (2 hours) |
| Upskilling Block 1 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 1 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 1 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 1 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 1 (2 hours) |
| Upskilling Block 2 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 2 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 2 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 2 (2 hours) | Upskilling Block 2 (2 hours) |

One important strategy with any new routine is to adapt it as you need. You will only learn about how well a routine supports your progress by trying it out and observing the results. If you find that you are unable to complete everything as you planned, don't beat yourself about it. Rather, take it as an opportunity to reflect on what got in your way, and make a plan to address it moving forward. For example, if you didn't reach out to the four employers you planned to on Monday, you might realize it's because you tend to spend a lot of time crafting each communication, and you ran out of steam after the second one. To address this, you could either find more efficient ways to craft your communications or spread them out more evenly over the week.

**Activity:** Create a weekly routine and enter it into your calendar of choice. We recommend using [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), but feel free to use another program. [Set up recurring events](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37115?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) so activities occur at a regular time without having to copy-and-paste, and you can edit individual occurrences as needed. You can even [add reminders](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6285327?hl=en) to help you avoid forgetting.

## Find Overlapping Tasks

The idea of getting so many required tasks complete every week while also
further developing your skills can feel daunting. Blogging, for instance, is not
something that everyone is entirely comfortable with, and even coming up with an
topic to write a blog post about can be difficult.

To help simplify the work, try to find ways to relate your required tasks and
complete them together. For instance, you need to make commits to your
repositories - these could be improvements you are implementing in your porfolio
projects. This way, you're improving the projects you want to showcase to
employers while fulfilling the Career Services commitment.

Can you also _blog_ about the project you're working on? Maybe you are grappling
with a particular concept you're trying to learn and apply. Can you explain the
challenge in writing?

Another example, you might be looking at specific job openings and companies
you'd like to apply to. How can you shape your projects to look good for
individuals at these companies? Can you preemptively write a blog post about a
topic you want to show off to _these_ employers? If so, you'll be giving
yourself a talking point to bring up to them and will be more prepared to
discuss the topic if it comes up.

## Mapping Out the Road Ahead

Six months of job searching is a lot of time. It isn't easy to imagine, let alone
_plan_ what the next six months will look like for you. However, taking some
time to write down a roadmap for yourself can be very helpful - it can clarify your
goals and help you prioritize. It can also help prevent anxiety caused by
trying to keep tabs on everything entirely in your head.

When writing out a roadmap for the next six months, don't think about the time as
one large chunk of time. Instead, think about the time in milestones - where
would you like to be in _one month?_ What do you feel is realistically achievable
in that time?

Your roadmap will be unique to you, and you will likely revise it repeatedly
over time. Still, having a physical copy can help you to review where you are
against your planned goals.

To help you get started, below are some suggested milestones based on the Career
Services Commitment and some of the content in this track. Use this as a
starting point and adjust it to fit your own plans and goals.

### First Month

At the end of your first month, you should aim to have the following completed:

* Four post-grad blog posts published
* 32 total contacts made with prospective employers
* At least two of your portfolio projects fully polished and deployed online

In addition to these, this first month is a good time to do some self-assessing.
Take some time to identify what technical topics you need improvement on. For
instance, are there any reoccurring topics or skills you should learn based on
the jobs you've applied for? If you've gone through any interviews, what sort of
feedback have you received?

Use these questions to help shape goals for your next milestone.

### Second Month

* Eight post-grad blog posts published
* 64 total contacts made with prospective employers
* At this point, most of your portfolio projects should be fully polished and
  deployed online
* Your personal website is up and running
* You've worked through most of the Computer Science content in this track and
  have started completing code challenges on a site like [CodeWars][]

### Third Month

* 12 post-grad blog posts published
* 96 total contacts made with prospective employers
* You've completed many code challenges and are comfortable talking about some
  of the common code interview data structures like binary search trees and
  linked lists
* You've continued to advance your JavaScript skills by learning more about
  Node, Express, and have started building a new project using full-stack
  JavaScript

### Fourth Month

* 16 post-grad blog posts
* 128 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've spent significant time practicing your interview skills and
  incorporating feedback from the interviews you've had so far. You are
  comfortable answering many of the [most common interview questions][]
* You've finished and deployed your first post-graduate portfolio project
* You've started writing tests for your projects and are incorporating some into
  your existing portfolio projects

### Fifth Month

* 20 post-grad blog posts
* 160 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've participated in a hackathon and have continued to improve your
  submission, turning it into an additional portfolio project
* You've worked your way through the first half of [Eloquent JS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* You've greatly improved your knowledge of React and incorporated Hooks and
  Context into a project

### Sixth Month

At the end of six months, you should have all of the requirements for the Career
Services Commitment completed. With six months of continued learning, you'll
have significantly improved your skills compared to where you were at the
beginning of this journey.

* 24 post-grad blog posts
* 192 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've finished [Eloquent JS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* Based on some of the jobs you've been interested in, you've started to learn
  TypeScript and have used it in your React projects

## Conclusion

Again, beyond the required tasks, your roadmap will not have the same goals as
those listed above. It will be shaped by your own self-assessments, the types of
jobs you're applying for, and topics that interest you the most.

The essential concept here is that you build your own structure. Don't keep it
all in your head. Use whatever tools work for you to establish an effective
routine and try to stick to it.

The greatest challenge during this time isn't learning and improving skills -
you've already proven you can do that. The greatest challenge is **developing
the habits you will need to continually work towards your goals**.
