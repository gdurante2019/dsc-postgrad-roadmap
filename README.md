# Post-Graduate Roadmap

## Introduction

As you embark on your job search, it can be hard to establish routines that work
for you. Part of the reason boot camp courses are successful is that it provides
some degree structure to hold you accountable. Now that you are on your own, it
is up to you to establish that structure for yourself.

Each individual student is different, and striking a balance between searching
for jobs and your personal life is a unique challenge. Based on successful
students in the past, this lesson includes some suggestions for how to structure
your time - both week to week and for the next few months.

## Laying Out the Work Ahead

Before anything else, we recommend taking a moment to account for the things you
will be responsible for during this job search. For starters, there are
specific requirements you will need to meet as part of the
[Career Services Commitment][] that are required to remain eligible for
Flatiron's Money-Back Guarantee. [The Weekly Job Search Activity][] lesson from
our Career Prep track goes into greater detail on each requirement and includes a
lot of useful advice. We recommend reading through that lesson before continuing.

To summarize, the Career Services Commitment requires you to complete the
following each week:

- Make contact with at least eight (8) individuals, verified by first, last name
  and title, at prospective employers within your field of study
- Post at least one (1) written or video blog post
- Post at least 5 GitHub contributions per week to your public GitHub profile

In addition to these, you will likely have your own list of tasks based on your
personal growth and career goals. At the moment, this list might include some or
all of the following:

- Polishing up and deploying your portfolio projects
- Building a personal website
- Practicing code interview challenges
- Practicing general interview questions
- Reviewing programming topics you want to be more comfortable with
- Self-care!

Take some time to brainstorm and write out the tasks you would like to
accomplish. Some of these will remain on your list throughout your job search,
while others might be short-term tasks (i.e. you only need to build your personal
website once). Note while tasks you _must_ accomplish every week like the CSC
requirements. These take priority.

## Establish a Weekly Routine

With your list of tasks, you can now plan a routine for yourself. Some students
find it helpful to use a Google calendar to do this - you can block out time,
configure reminders, and set up reoccurring weekly events to help stay on track.

Map out a routine that works best for you. We _highly recommend_ front-loading
priority tasks, especially if you know that you are prone to procrastination. It
feels good to get the required tasks out of the way early. It feels bad to be
stressing over these tasks late in the week. Beyond that, if you get required
tasks out of the way, you may find more time to work on other beneficial tasks
that would otherwise be delayed.

Here is an example of what this weekly calendar might look like:

| Monday        | Tuesday           | Wednesday  | Thursday | Friday |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Contact 4 individuals at prospective employers | | Contact 4 individuals at prospective employers | | |
| Start researching blog post topic | Start writing blog post | Finish blog post and publicize | | |
| | | Commit to personal GitHub projects | Commit to personal GitHub projects | Commit to personal GitHub projects |

Or, if you're feeling ambitious you might want to front-load even more:

| Monday        | Tuesday           | Wednesday  | Thursday | Friday |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Contact 4 individuals at prospective employers | Contact 4 individuals at prospective employers | | | |
| Start writing blog post | Finish blog post| | | |
| Complete required GitHub commits | | | | |
| | | Work on personal projects | Work on personal projects | Work on personal projects |

Find a schedule that is realistic for you and your personal life, but do your
best to stick with it. Having a set routine has many benefits. It establishes
structure, removes the need to plan your time, and helps ensure you are getting
required tasks out of the way.

## Find Overlapping Tasks

The idea of getting so many required tasks complete every week while also
further developing your skills can feel daunting. Blogging, for instance, is not
something that everyone is entirely comfortable with, and even coming up with an
topic to write a blog post about can be difficult.

To help simplify the work, try to find ways to relate your required tasks and
complete them together. For instance, you need to make commits to your
repositories - these could be improvements you are implementing in your porfolio
projects. This way, you're improving the projects you want to showcase to
employers while fulfilling the Career Services commitment.

Can you also _blog_ about the project you're working on? Maybe you are grappling
with a particular concept you're trying to learn and apply. Can you explain the
challenge in writing?

Another example, you might be looking at specific job openings and companies
you'd like to apply to. How can you shape your projects to look good for
individuals at these companies? Can you preemptively write a blog post about a
topic you want to show off to _these_ employers? If so, you'll be giving
yourself a talking point to bring up to them and will be more prepared to
discuss the topic if it comes up.

## Mapping Out the Road Ahead

Six months of job searching is a lot of time. It isn't easy to imagine, let alone
_plan_ what the next six months will look like for you. However, taking some
time to write down a roadmap for yourself can be very helpful - it can clarify your
goals and help you prioritize. It can also help prevent anxiety caused by
trying to keep tabs on everything entirely in your head.

When writing out a roadmap for the next six months, don't think about the time as
one large chunk of time. Instead, think about the time in milestones - where
would you like to be in _one month?_ What do you feel is realistically achievable
in that time?

Your roadmap will be unique to you, and you will likely revise it repeatedly
over time. Still, having a physical copy can help you to review where you are
against your planned goals.

To help you get started, below are some suggested milestones based on the Career
Services Commitment and some of the content in this track. Use this as a
starting point and adjust it to fit your own plans and goals.

### First Month

At the end of your first month, you should aim to have the following completed:

* Four post-grad blog posts published
* 32 total contacts made with prospective employers
* At least two of your portfolio projects fully polished and deployed online

In addition to these, this first month is a good time to do some self-assessing.
Take some time to identify what technical topics you need improvement on. For
instance, are there any reoccurring topics or skills you should learn based on
the jobs you've applied for? If you've gone through any interviews, what sort of
feedback have you received?

Use these questions to help shape goals for your next milestone.

### Second Month

* Eight post-grad blog posts published
* 64 total contacts made with prospective employers
* At this point, most of your portfolio projects should be fully polished and
  deployed online
* Your personal website is up and running
* You've worked through most of the Computer Science content in this track and
  have started completing code challenges on a site like [CodeWars][]

* You've greatly improved your knowledge of React and incorporated Hooks and
  Context into a project

### Sixth Month

At the end of six months, you should have all of the requirements for the Career
Services Commitment completed. With six months of continued learning, you'll
have significantly improved your skills compared to where you were at the
beginning of this journey.

* 24 post-grad blog posts
* 192 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've finished [Eloquent JS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* Based on some of the jobs you've been interested in, you've started to learn
  TypeScript and have used it in your React projects

## Conclusion

Again, beyond the required tasks, your roadmap will not have the same goals as
those listed above. It will be shaped by your own self-assessments, the types of
jobs you're applying for, and topics that interest you the most.

The essential concept here is that you build your own structure. Don't keep it
all in your head. Use whatever tools work for you to establish an effective
routine and try to stick to it.

The greatest challenge during this time isn't learning and improving skills -
you've already proven you can do that. The greatest challenge is **developing
the habits you will need to continually work towards your goals**.
